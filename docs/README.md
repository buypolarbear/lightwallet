# Etherify LightWallet App

## Goals

Our goal is provide a user-friendly ethereum light wallet designed for the average user who don’t know very much about  crypto-currencies and help them to receive and send Ether and other tokens like DGD, DAO, Unicorns, and others.

## Trustless App

First of all, Etherify Lightwallet don’t send any information to any private backend server/api. Actually Etherify use the ConsenSys  eth-lightwallet.js javascript library to keep an HD wallet encrypted in the smartphone, and communicate with any Hooked Web3 Provider (https://github.com/ConsenSys/hooked-web3-provider ) in order to send signed transactions to the ethereum network without being an ethereum node.
